  <h2 class="box">Hydrangea</h2>
  
  <div class="information">
    <p>Hydrangea is a genus of 70-75 species of flowering plants native to southern and eastern Asia and the Americas. By far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China, Japan, and Korea.</p>
    <p>Scientific name: Hydrangea</p>

  <h2 class="box">Life cycle</h2>
  
  <div class="information">
    <p>Hydrangea flowers are produced from early spring to late autumn; they grow in flowerheads (corymbs or panicles) at the ends of the stems. In many species, the flowerheads contain two types of flowers, small fertile flowers in the middle of the flowerhead, and large, sterile bract-like flowers in a ring around the edge of each flowerhead. Other species have all the flowers sterile and of the same size.</p>

  <h2 class="box">Colors and soil acidity</h2>
  
  <div class="information">
    <p>In most species the flowers are white, but in some species (notably H. macrophylla), can be blue, red, pink, light purple, or dark purple. In these species the color is affected by soil pH.[3[4] For H. macrophylla and H. serrata cultivars, the flower color can be determined by the relative acidity of the soil: an acidic soil (pH below 6), by the influence of sundry agents in the soil, such as alum or iron, will usually produce flower color closer to blue,[5] whereas an alkaline soil (pH above 6) will produce flowers more pink. This is caused by a color change of the flower pigments in the presence of aluminium ions which can be taken up into hyperaccumulating plants.<br/><br/>source:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrangea</p>
